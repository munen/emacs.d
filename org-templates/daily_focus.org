*** PROJECT [#A] %(org-insert-time-stamp (current-time)) Daily focus

**** Process

    - [ ] Start by setting one Pomodoro just to get the day organized
    - [ ] Set a timetable for today
      - Set a timer to enforce free time and get rid of the five more
        minutes syndrome
    - [ ] First, think: Is there an obvious TODO on my mind?
    - Otherwise, start by looking at the calendar
    - [ ] Then look at the daily agenda in org
    - If nothing sticks out, look at the 'next action' for the current
      context
    - [ ] After some quality work has been done, start mu4e
      - Capture all emails, adhere to the 2min rule
    - Start Slack
    - [ ] Always: When it's not clear what the current task is, _pick_
      one task and start a pomodoro to remind yourself which task
      you're working on
